## Key Findings

### 1. Overall Impact on New Incorporations

The project starts by analyzing the trends in new incorporations across the largest and smallest industries in the UK. Notably, after each of the three lockdowns, a significant number of new companies emerged, with four out of five minor sectors experiencing growth. The observations suggest potential factors such as government loans and entrepreneurial initiatives.

### 2. Sector-Specific Insights

After the first lockdown, the 'Public administration and defence; compulsory social security' sector saw a substantial increase in new incorporations, followed by a decline after the third lockdown. In contrast, 'Mining and Quarrying' showed minimal impact. The largest industries generally experienced growth after each lockdown, particularly after the first. Notably, 'Wholesale and retail trade' demonstrated a notable increase.

### 3. Focus on London's Largest Industries

The analysis extends to London, examining trends in new incorporations among the largest industries. Despite the three lockdowns, most sectors exhibited growth, with only a 3% decrease in 'Professional activities.' 'Wholesale and retail' and 'Construction' saw significant fluctuations, indicating a dynamic response to the pandemic.
