# Project Name: COVID-19 Impact on Businesses in the UK

## Overview and Purpose of the Repository

This repository serves as a demonstration of utilizing different Python visualization libraries to analyze and visualize the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on businesses in the United Kingdom. The project spans from January 2019 to December 2021, offering insights into various industries using both Seaborn and Plotly for creating compelling visualizations. The initial line chart showcases the same data but implemented with both libraries, providing a comparative view of their visualization styles.

## Key Findings

### 1. Overall Impact on New Incorporations (Seaborn and Plotly Line Charts)

The project begins by analyzing trends in new incorporations across the largest and smallest industries in the UK. After each of the three lockdowns, a significant number of new companies emerged, with four out of five minor sectors experiencing growth. The observations suggest potential factors such as government loans and entrepreneurial initiatives.

### 2. Sector-Specific Insights (Interactive Plotly Line Chart)

After the first lockdown, the 'Public administration and defence; compulsory social security' sector saw a substantial increase in new incorporations, followed by a decline after the third lockdown. In contrast, 'Mining and Quarrying' showed minimal impact. The largest industries generally experienced growth after each lockdown, particularly after the first. Notably, 'Wholesale and retail trade' demonstrated a notable increase.

### 3. Focus on London's Largest Industries (Plotly Bar Chart)

The analysis extends to London, examining trends in new incorporations among the largest industries. Despite the three lockdowns, most sectors exhibited growth, with only a 3% decrease in 'Professional activities.' 'Wholesale and retail' and 'Construction' saw significant fluctuations, indicating a dynamic response to the pandemic.

### 4. Geospatial Analysis of Real Estate Activities (Plotly Geospatial Chart)

The project concludes with a geospatial representation of new incorporations in the 'Real estate activities' sector. This industry, a significant player in the UK, witnessed new incorporations mainly around the London zone but spread across the entire country. The analysis reveals emerging opportunities and growth areas, showcasing the resilience of businesses amidst the challenges posed by the pandemic.
